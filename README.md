 Shine Web services
 This is a simple web page design made for Shine web services
 It is built with HTML 5 only, No back end.
 You can check out the UI View
 Even I have built several websites using frameworks like Bootsrap, Semantic UI, W3CSS etc
 I did this just for fun, Inspired by Brad Traversy and something with no frameworks
 Maybe I will use it someday by adding a backend to it
 Feel free to copy and Enjoy
